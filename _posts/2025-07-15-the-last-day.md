As the title suggests, today is the last day of my internship at QNAP. Although I received my certificate of internship a few weeks ago, I still worked on some tasks—such as debugging the NATS configuration on the PR site—because QNAP hosted a results presentation for all interns whose internships were finishing in recent months. Today marks the end of a special phase of my life: my first work experience. I truly appreciate my colleagues. I was new to practical projects and workplace tasks at the beginning of this internship, but they taught me how to set up the development environment and explained in detail the products they are working on, which helped me get on track quickly. Without their help, I could not have absorbed this industry knowledge and these skills, which are very important for my future career. I will miss the time I spent here and the people I met.

Soon, I will start packing my belongings and preparing for my next journey to UMich. I keep saying that I am an 'incoming' MDS student at UMich, but that won't be true for long. Before I know it, I'll be a 'current' student.
