VizThinker is AVAILABLE NOW!

This is an exciting moment for me as a developer—I’ve just deployed my first personal project to the cloud! I chose Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for its balance of budget-friendliness and cost-effectiveness, and I used Docker Compose as my deployment tool.

Both GCP and Docker Compose were new to me, so going through the entire deployment process has been a huge learning experience. Although I’ve invested a lot of effort into VizThinker, there are still several bugs and user experience issues that need to be addressed. In the next stage, I’ll focus on improving the Chatnode layout and click interactions, making them more intuitive and enhancing overall readability. My goal is to evolve VizThinker into a more polished and mature product through a series of updates and refinements.

If time allows before the start of the next semester, my next major feature will be adding self-dragging edges for Chatnodes, letting user to build connections for chatnodes in different branches. I’ll continue sharing updates as development progresses!
