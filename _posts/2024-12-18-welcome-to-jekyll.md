# Welcome to my Jekyll blog!

This is my first post using Jekyll. Here's what I've learned about customizing Jekyll:

## What Jekyll can do:

- **Static site generation**: Convert Markdown to HTML automatically
- **Blog-aware**: Built-in support for blog posts with dates and categories  
- **Theme support**: Easy to change the look and feel
- **Liquid templating**: Dynamic content with variables and logic

## Next steps:

I plan to write about:
- My data science journey at University of Michigan
- Internship experiences at QNAP
- Technical projects and learning

You can edit this post in `_posts/2024-12-18-welcome-to-jekyll.md` and re-build the site to see your changes.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.
