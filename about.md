## Background
My story begins in Tainan, a vibrant Taiwanese city known for its endless sunshine and incredible food. It was there, while studying for my Civil Engineering degree at NCKU, that I had a realization. While I was learning to build bridges and buildings, I found myself completely captivated by the elegant logic of building a program from a blank screen.

I decided to follow that passion, which led me to a Master's in Computer Science at NTHU and a deep dive into Quantum Computing. But the real turning point came during my cloud development internship at QNAP. It was a revelation. I saw firsthand how machine learning and data science were becoming the new bedrock of innovation, solving problems in ways I had never imagined.

That experience ignited a new mission. Now, as I pack my bags for Ann Arbor to begin my Master of Data Science at the University of Michigan, I’m more driven than ever. I am a builder at heart, and I am committed to a lifetime of learning, eager to construct the data-driven technologies that will define our future.
