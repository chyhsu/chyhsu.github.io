# MongoDB DevDay 2025

===================================

## Attend MongoDB DevDay Taipei 2025

I attended the MongoDB DevDay Taipei 2025, as my internship is nearing its end. I really appreciate the opportunity to join this tech event, where I learned about how to efficiently migrate from a relation DB to a non-relation DB and obtained some badges to show my achievement. The most interesting part was the speaker's demonstration of how RAG, LLM and MongoDB can be combined to build a knowledge base for a company. If it could be applied into my future sideproject, it will definitely be exciting.
