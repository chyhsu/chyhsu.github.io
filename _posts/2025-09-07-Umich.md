My journey at the Umich is just beginning. 

After several weeks of hustling, I have finally settled down in Ann Arbor and started my first semester at the University of Michigan. Coming from a tropical climate, it hasn’t been easy to adapt to Ann Arbor’s weather, but I’m enjoying the experience and learning new things every day. So far, life here has been good, and everything is moving in the right direction.

This semester, I am taking Regression Analysis, Data Science in Python, Theoretical Statistics, and Parallel Computing. I am also working on Lilac, a research project under Prof. Ang Chen that leverages LLMs and symbolic methods to automate Infrastructure-as-Code lifting across cloud platforms. I see this as a valuable opportunity to learn and grow both as a researcher and a developer.

In addition, I am continuing my work on VizThinker. Recently, OpenAI released a new feature for branching chats, which overlaps in part with my idea of Chatnode branching—though it is not exactly the same. I am excited to see this development, as it validates my belief that the idea behind VizThinker is both practical and innovative in enhancing the user experience of LLMs. I will keep improving VizThinker and push it even further.
